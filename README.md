# Repository: Fine-Tuning Stable Diffusion Models

## Overview

This repository contains notebooks and resources for fine-tuning stable diffusion models. Stable diffusion models are powerful generative models capable of producing high-quality samples across a variety of domains. Fine-tuning these models allows users to adapt them to specific datasets, enhancing their flexibility.

## Contents

- **finetune_sd_1_5.ipynb** this notebook focuses on the finetuning of stable diffusion v1.5, a lightweight model but not very performant. More details [here](https://medium.com/@momayiz.imane/inviting-stable-diffusion-model-to-morocco-edf91a764458). 
- **finetune_sdxl.ipynb** this notebook focuses on the finetuning of stable diffusion XL, a more robust model that captures more details in images. More details [here](https://medium.com/@momayiz.imane/dreambooth-x-lora-efficient-finetuning-of-text2img-models-21fea5f5e12a).
